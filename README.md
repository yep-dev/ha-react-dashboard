Includes:
- base components I used as a building blocks for the UI, that you can reuse as well
- cards – sections of the screen with components connected to the entities, so also serving as the example of components usage
- screens – some my dashboard's screens that serve as the main entrypoint and layout for cards 
- all in the setup ready clone, develop and deploy your own dashboard

The icons are from the paid set from [streamline](https://www.streamlinehq.com/) You need to subscribe to them to get additional icons. You can easily replace them with your own or with `@iconify/react` ones used by `@hakit` – it includes the HA default material icons too.
